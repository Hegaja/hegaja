<i>Boring introduction</i>
</summary>
<p>Passionate about programming and software automation, I have experience with web development and embedded systems. <br/>
Graduated in electrical engineering at UFRN, as an exchange student at the University of Limerick (Ireland). <br/>
I work with embedded software development in Linux, with good knowledge in C ++. In my daily job, I work in a middleware named Ginga who is developed in C++ and embedded in all Brazilian Samsung TVs. My routine involves bugfix and refactorization, building the project in Jenkins and using GIT as a control system.<br/>
I have experience with Front-End, having worked as a freelancer in the past. Currently web development is a hobby that I like to develop in my spare time. <br/>
I'm behind <a href="https://siteligeiro.com.br">site ligeiro</a> (content in portuguese), a software as a product concept. <br/>
Sometimes good ideas appear, nothing better than putting them into practice. So I decided to learn React.js to develop cool web apps like  <a href="https://webtexteditor.com">web text editor</a>.
